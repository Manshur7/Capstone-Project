### Hello everyone, welcome to my Capstone Project Weblog. This blog will be used to monitor each and every step of my final year project and help you follow along to how I completed this task. It will be updated on a weekly basis for the most part as I complete the set targets based off my course outline.

##### During week 8 we had to design our PCBs and get them done and available for soldering. Week 9 was based on soldering our PCB with the respective headers in order to accomodate the sensors and the Raspberry Pi. Soldering was completed during week 9 but unfortunately I ran into in issue with my raspberry pi connection to any kind of virtual connection.(Still working on it.)

##### After the reading week, which we used to assemble the breadboards and finalize the design as well as fixing connection issues with the rpi and computers. For week 8, we had to demo how our breadboard was working and the readings( which I didn't have at the time.)

##### Week 7 had us download the OS for our development platforms. We also had to design and assemble the Breadboarded part of the project to demonstrate the connectivity of our platforms to the sensors and how readings were being taken.

##### For week 6, we had to upload images of our designed Printed Circuit Boards as well as the circuit diagram with all the necessarry connections. Please follow the link to the images:

##### During week 5, we were supposed to have ordered our parts from our manufacturers and have a receipt which acknowledged the latter. Below are the 2 parts I will be using.

##### Welcome to week 4, during this week we had to plan a reasonable budget which contained the parts we were going to buy and was to be approved by our professor, Kristian Medri. Below is a link to my detailed budget plan.

##### Hey everyone, this is week 3 & this week we were supposed to have scheduled our project using the appropriate scheduling tools. Mine was conceived using Microsoft Project Planner(MPP). Here's a link to the project schedule.

#### Blog Entry #1 (2019/09/10)
##### Hi there, welcome to week 2 of the Capstone Project. During the past week and the current one, we were supposed to have decided which project we were going to work on and choose the one we found reasonable and feasible. We chose the Lumi Monitor project as we had some ideas on how to approach this particular problem. Therefore, we decided to go forward with the lumi monitor and below is a link to the detailed proposal for the project.

#### Blog Entry #0 (2019/09/03)
##### Hello there, this is the first week of the Capstone project. We have been introduced to the various available projects and have until next week to choose one. We are currently thinking about the Lumi Monitor which looks like not only a creative but also an achievable project. Please check in next week to see the progress and our actual choice.
